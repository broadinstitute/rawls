      # A known github bug results in 'annotations generated in a Github action during a step executed in
      # the “pull request” event, end up in the “workflow” for the "push’ event.'
      # Until they fix that problem, we must ensure this step creates a unique check_name, else
      # the pull_request and push checks will overwrite each other.
